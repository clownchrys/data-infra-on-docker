#   --help
# 	Print usage

# Server:
#   --id <string>
# 	Identifier for this server.
#   --exit-timeout-secs <integer>
# 	Timeout (in seconds) when exiting to wait for in-flight
# 	inferences to finish. After the timeout expires the server exits even if
# 	inferences are still in flight.

# Logging:
#   --log-verbose <integer>
# 	Set verbose logging level. Zero (0) disables verbose logging
# 	and values >= 1 enable verbose logging.
#   --log-info <boolean>
# 	Enable/disable info-level logging.
#   --log-warning <boolean>
# 	Enable/disable warning-level logging.
#   --log-error <boolean>
# 	Enable/disable error-level logging.
#   --log-format <string>
# 	Set the logging format. Options are "default" and "ISO8601".
# 	The default is "default". For "default", the log severity (L) and
# 	timestamp will be logged as "LMMDD hh:mm:ss.ssssss". For "ISO8601",
# 	the log format will be "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ L".
#   --log-file <string>
# 	Set the name of the log output file. If specified, log
# 	outputs will be saved to this file. If not specified, log outputs will
# 	stream to the console.

# Model Repository:
#   --model-store <string>
# 	Equivalent to --model-repository.
#   --model-repository <string>
# 	Path to model repository directory. It may be specified
# 	multiple times to add multiple model repositories. Note that if a model
# 	is not unique across all model repositories at any time, the model
# 	will not be available.
#   --exit-on-error <boolean>
# 	Exit the inference server if an error occurs during
# 	initialization.
#   --disable-auto-complete-config
# 	If set, disables the triton and backends from auto
# 	completing model configuration files. Model configuration files must be
# 	provided and all required configuration settings must be specified.
#   --strict-readiness <boolean>
# 	If true /v2/health/ready endpoint indicates ready if the
# 	server is responsive and all models are available. If false
# 	/v2/health/ready endpoint indicates ready if server is responsive even if
# 	some/all models are unavailable.
#   --model-control-mode <string>
# 	Specify the mode for model management. Options are "none",
# 	"poll" and "explicit". The default is "none". For "none", the server
# 	will load all models in the model repository(s) at startup and will
# 	not make any changes to the load models after that. For "poll", the
# 	server will poll the model repository(s) to detect changes and will
# 	load/unload models based on those changes. The poll rate is
# 	controlled by 'repository-poll-secs'. For "explicit", model load and unload
# 	is initiated by using the model control APIs, and only models
# 	specified with --load-model will be loaded at startup.
#   --repository-poll-secs <integer>
# 	Interval in seconds between each poll of the model
# 	repository to check for changes. Valid only when --model-control-mode=poll is
# 	specified.

# 	Name of the model to be loaded on server startup. It may be
# 	specified multiple times to add multiple models. To load ALL models
# 	at startup, specify '*' as the model name with --load-model=* as the
# 	ONLY --load-model argument, this does not imply any pattern
# 	matching. Specifying --load-model=* in conjunction with another
# 	--load-model argument will result in error. Note that this option will only
# 	take effect if --model-control-mode=explicit is true.

# 	"execution_count" and "off". The default is "off". For "execution_count", the
# 	server will determine the instance using configured priority and the
# 	number of time the instance has been used to run inference. The
# 	inference will finally be executed once the required resources are
# 	available. For "off", the server will ignore any rate limiter config and
# 	run inference as soon as an instance is ready.
#   --rate-limit-resource <<string>:<integer>:<integer>>
# 	The number of resources available to the server. The format
# 	of this flag is
# 	--rate-limit-resource=<resource_name>:<count>:<device>. The <device> is optional and if not listed will be applied to
# 	every device. If the resource is specified as "GLOBAL" in the model
# 	configuration the resource is considered shared among all the devices
# 	in the system. The <device> property is ignored for such resources.
# 	This flag can be specified multiple times to specify each resources
# 	and their availability. By default, the max across all instances
# 	that list the resource is selected as its availability. The values for
# 	this flag is case-insensitive.

# Memory/Device Management:
#   --pinned-memory-pool-byte-size <integer>
# 	The total byte size that can be allocated as pinned system
# 	memory. If GPU support is enabled, the server will allocate pinned
# 	system memory to accelerate data transfer between host and devices
# 	until it exceeds the specified byte size. If 'numa-node' is configured
# 	via --host-policy, the pinned system memory of the pool size will be
# 	allocated on each numa node. This option will not affect the
# 	allocation conducted by the backend frameworks. Default is 256 MB.
#   --cuda-memory-pool-byte-size <<integer>:<integer>>
# 	The total byte size that can be allocated as CUDA memory for
# 	the GPU device. If GPU support is enabled, the server will allocate
# 	CUDA memory to minimize data transfer between host and devices
# 	until it exceeds the specified byte size. This option will not affect
# 	the allocation conducted by the backend frameworks. The argument
# 	should be 2 integers separated by colons in the format <GPU device
# 	ID>:<pool byte size>. This option can be used multiple times, but only
# 	once per GPU device. Subsequent uses will overwrite previous uses for
# 	the same GPU device. Default is 64 MB.
#   --cuda-virtual-address-size <<integer>:<integer>>
# 	The total CUDA virtual address size that will be used for
# 	each implicit state when growable memory is used. This value
# 	determines the maximum size of each implicit state. The state size cannot go
# 	beyond this value. The argument should be 2 integers separated by
# 	colons in the format <GPU device ID>:<CUDA virtual address size>. This
# 	option can be used multiple times, but only once per GPU device.
# 	Subsequent uses will overwrite previous uses for the same GPU device.
# 	Default is 1 GB.
#   --min-supported-compute-capability <float>
# 	The minimum supported CUDA compute capability. GPUs that
# 	don't support this compute capability will not be used by the server.
#   --buffer-manager-thread-count <integer>
# 	The number of threads used to accelerate copies and other
# 	operations required to manage input and output tensor contents.
# 	Default is 0.
#   --host-policy <<string>,<string>=<string>>
# 	Specify a host policy setting associated with a policy name.
# 	The format of this flag is
# 	--host-policy=<policy_name>,<setting>=<value>. Currently supported settings are 'numa-node', 'cpu-cores'.
# 	Note that 'numa-node' setting will affect pinned memory pool behavior,
# 	see --pinned-memory-pool for more detail.
#   --model-load-gpu-limit <<device_id>:<fraction>>
# 	Specify the limit on GPU memory usage as a fraction. If
# 	model loading on the device is requested and the current memory usage
# 	exceeds the limit, the load will be rejected. If not specified, the
# 	limit will not be set.

# DEPRECATED:
#   --strict-model-config <boolean>
# 	DEPRECATED: If true model configuration files must be
# 	provided and all required configuration settings must be specified. If
# 	false the model configuration may be absent or only partially specified
# 	and the server will attempt to derive the missing required
# 	configuration.
#   --response-cache-byte-size <integer>
# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --cache-config instead.
#   --trace-file <string>
# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --trace-config
# 	triton,file=<path/to/your/file> Set the file where trace output will be saved. If
# 	--trace-log-frequency is also specified, this argument value will be the
# 	prefix of the files to save the trace output. See --trace-log-frequency
# 	for detail.
#   --trace-level <string>
# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --trace-config
# 	level=<OFF|TIMESTAMPS|TENSORS>Specify a trace level. OFF to disable tracing, TIMESTAMPS to
# 	trace timestamps, TENSORS to trace tensors. It may be specified
# 	multiple times to trace multiple information. Default is OFF.

# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --trace-config rate=<rate value>Set
# 	the trace sampling rate. Default is 1000.
#   --trace-count <integer>
# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --trace-config count=<count value>Set
# 	the number of traces to be sampled. If the value is -1, the number
# 	of traces to be sampled will not be limited. Default is -1.
#   --trace-log-frequency <integer>
# 	DEPRECATED: Please use --trace-config
# 	triton,log-frequency=<value>Set the trace log frequency. If the value is 0, Triton will
# 	only log the trace output to <trace-file> when shutting down.
# 	Otherwise, Triton will log the trace output to <trace-file>.<idx> when it
# 	collects the specified number of traces. For example, if the log
# 	frequency is 100, when Triton collects the 100-th trace, it logs the
# 	traces to file <trace-file>.0, and when it collects the 200-th trace, it
# 	logs the 101-th to the 200-th traces to file <trace-file>.1.
# 	Default is 0.
